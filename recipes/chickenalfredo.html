    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken alfredo is a classic favorite—a creamy white sauce, long strands
      of pasta mixed with tender pieces of lean protein. For this recipe, I cut
      the meat for quicker cooking and use a generous amount of seasonings for
      maximum flavor.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon black pepper, divided</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon paprika, sweet</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>3 quarts water</li>
      <li>8 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 ½ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese, or parmigiano reggiano</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Chicken</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut each chicken breast in half lengthwise to create two cutlets, four
        total.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl combine 1 teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, and paprika.
        Evenly season both sides of the chicken with the spice mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the
        olive oil. Add the chicken and cook until the surface is browned, about
        5 for 6 minutes. Flip and cook until the internal temperature reaches
        160 to 165ºF (71 to 74ºC), about 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Wash and dry the
        pan to use for making the alfredo sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Pasta</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil. Add 1 ½ teaspoon
        salt, stir to dissolve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 10 to 12 minutes, or
        according to the manufacturer's directions. Use tongs to transfer to a
        colander—Reserve the starchy pasta water. While the pasta cooks, make
        the alfredo sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Alfredo Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add butter. Once melted, add
        garlic and saute until fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds. Do not brown the
        butter or garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the heavy cream, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper, stir to
        combine. Bring the cream to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, frequently
        stirring, scraping the sides and bottom of the pan to make sure the
        cream does not curdle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the sauce to about 1 cup, 10 to 12 minutes. It should be slightly
        thickened and be able to coat the back of a spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat and stir in the parmesan cheese and nutmeg. If the
        sauce is too thick, add water or cream. Add 1 tablespoon at a time until
        you reach the desired consistency—season with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
    </ol>
