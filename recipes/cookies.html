    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A chocolate chip cookie is a sweet baked treat that is recognized by its
      butter flavor and the inclusion of chocolate chips. Some variations can
      include nuts, oatmeal or raisins as well.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks
        of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars
        creates a perfectly balanced flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they
        help hold the dough together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate
        chip cookies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the
        cookies rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the
        baking soda to puff the cookies up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but
        it won't make the cookies taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to
        the cookie dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You
        can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a
        welcome crunch.
      </li>
    </ul>
